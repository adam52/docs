# Create And Reorder Pages

To create and reorder new pages, you can simply use the navigation on the right side of the author panel. You can choose to create a new folder or a file. You can also move and re-order items with drag & drop.

There are some limitations that you should know:

* Special characters are not allowed in the navigation.
* The number of characters in a page name is limited to 80 right now.
* You can move a content file where you want, but you cannot move it to the root level (only folders are allowed there).
* You can move a folder within the same level, but you cannot move a folder inside another folder.

The reasons for these limitations are obvious: If you move a folder to another folder, then all urls of the folder and its files will change. This is a nightmare for your readers and for search-engines, so we decided to restrict it a bit.
