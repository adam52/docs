# Use Cases

TYPEMILL is a small CMS dedicated to writers and their text work. If you want to publish a finished text as a website, and if you like using Markdown, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Here are some ideas of what you can publish with TYPEMILL:

- documentation
- pillar websites
- lyric collections
- lightweight wikis
- user guides
- handbooks
- manuals
- studies
- tutorials
- whitepapers
- ebooks
- collections of articles

You can also create a portfolio-website or a classic website with TYPEMILL. But for now, TYPEMILL does not support time-based entries, so if you want to create a blog or a news magazine, then you should look for another CMS.
