# Features

TYPEMILL provides a lot of useful features, and we add new features every few weeks. This is what you can do with TYPEMILL right now:

- Super simple setup of a new website. 
- Add new users with full admin-rights or limited editor-rights.
- Create and edit your content online, or simply upload markdown-files (e.g. via FTP).
- Create and re-order pages with drag & drop directly in the navigation-tree.
- Fully control the visibility of a page with draft, publish, and depublish states. 
- Revise a page while you keep the original version online (even WP does not have this in its core functionality!).
- Use raw markdown syntax or a fancy visual block-editor to edit content. 
- The visual block-editor provides image-uploads, markdown-tables, and much more.
- Markdown supports extra formats like table of contents (TOC), footnotes, and even math.
- Choose and configure themes and plugins.
- Write your own themes with HTML, CSS, and Twig.
- Write your own plugins with PHP.

TYPEMILL-websites are SEO-friendly, with pretty urls and a google-sitemap out of the box. There's also full navigation, breadcrumbs, paging, chapter-numbers and much more. 

TYPEMILL already runs several successful websites like [cmsstash.de](https://cmsstash.de), my own special interest website with more than 10% growth each month. But TYPEMILL is also a work in progress. You might miss some features, but they will be added in future for sure.
